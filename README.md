# venmo-mcp

An MCP server that exposes Venmo functionality to AI assistants like [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code). Built with [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp) and the unofficial [venmo-api](https://github.com/mmber01/venmo-api) Python library.

## Tools

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `search_users` | Search for Venmo users by name or username |
| `send_money` | Send money to a user (supports privacy settings and funding source selection) |
| `request_money` | Request money from a user |
| `get_payment_methods` | List available payment methods (balance, bank accounts, cards) |
| `get_friends` | List the authenticated user's friends |
| `get_my_profile` | Get the authenticated user's profile |

## Prerequisites

- [Pixi](https://pixi.sh) (dependency manager)
- A Venmo account

## Setup

1. Clone this repo:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aaymeloglu/venmo-mcp.git
   cd venmo-mcp
   ```

2. Get your Venmo device ID:

   Venmo requires a real device ID from an active session (random ones are rejected). The easiest way to get one:

   1. Log into [venmo.com](https://venmo.com) in Chrome
   2. Open DevTools (F12) > Network tab
   3. Click around in Venmo (check balance, view a transaction, etc.)
   4. Look for requests to `api.venmo.com` and find the `venmo-device-id` request header
   5. Copy the value (looks like `fp01-xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx`)

   You only need to do this once. The device ID is saved alongside your token.

3. Authenticate with Venmo:

   ```bash
   pixi run auth
   ```

   This prompts for your device ID, username, and password. Venmo will likely send a 2FA code via SMS -- enter it when prompted. On success, the access token is saved to `.venmo-token`. The token does not expire unless manually revoked.

3. Add to your Claude Code MCP config (`.mcp.json`):

   ```json
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "venmo": {
         "type": "stdio",
         "command": "pixi",
         "args": [
           "run",
           "--manifest-path",
           "/path/to/venmo-mcp/pixi.toml",
           "python",
           "/path/to/venmo-mcp/server.py"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

   Replace `/path/to/venmo-mcp` with the actual path to your clone.

## Running standalone

```bash
pixi run serve
```

## Token management

The access token is stored in `.venmo-token` (gitignored). To re-authenticate, delete the file and run `pixi run auth` again.

## Security

This server can send real money. Use with appropriate caution. The token file is created with `0600` permissions (owner-only read/write).
